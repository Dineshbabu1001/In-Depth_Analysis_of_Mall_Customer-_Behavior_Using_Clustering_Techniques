ðŸš€ My INTERNSAVY Internship Task 2 - Unleashing Customer Insights through Clustering!



In my second task at INTERNSAVY, I embarked on an exciting journey of clustering customer data to gain valuable insights and shape more effective marketing strategies. ðŸŽ¯



Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): ðŸ“Š

I started by diving deep into the dataset, understanding customers' demographics, and visualizing key features like age, annual income, and spending score. I explored relationships between variables using pair plots, histograms, and kernel density plots, unraveling interesting patterns and trends.



Clustering Techniques: ðŸ§©

To segment customers into distinct groups, I unleashed a suite of clustering algorithms:



K-Means Clustering: Utilizing K-Means, I categorized customers into five clusters based on age, annual income, and spending score, with a spotlight on the cluster centroids.



Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative Clustering): Employing hierarchical clustering, I formed five clusters from standardized data, visualizing the results in an insightful scatter plot.

Hierarchical Clustering Dendrogram: A dendrogram was plotted, guiding me to the ideal number of clusters and allowing me to better interpret the data structure.



DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): By harnessing DBSCAN, I identified densely populated regions in the data without the need for pre-defining cluster numbers.



Mean Shift Clustering: Mean Shift revealed dense regions within the dataset without specifying the number of clusters, enriching our understanding of customer behavior.



Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Clustering: Using GMM, I modeled customer data as a mixture of Gaussian distributions, and the resulting clusters were visualized alongside the cluster centers.



Birch Clustering: Leveraging Birch, an efficient hierarchical algorithm, I skillfully grouped data points, revealing unique customer segments.



Unlocking the Power of Customer Segmentation: ðŸ’¡

Customer segmentation is a potent tool for crafting personalized marketing strategies, providing tailored experiences, and enhancing customer satisfaction. Through clustering, we gain deeper insights into customers' preferences, behavior, and needs, paving the way for data-driven decision-making. ðŸŽ‰


I am thrilled to have completed this task at INTERNSAVY, honing my skills in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning. Special thanks to my mentors for their guidance and support throughout this enriching experience.
